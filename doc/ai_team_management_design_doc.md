# AI Team Management Webapp - Complete Design Document

## Executive Summary

The AI Team Management Webapp is a productivity platform designed to coordinate AI development teams through a central Producer AI agent while maintaining complete human oversight and control. The primary goal is eliminating context switching between multiple AI tools while providing full visibility into development processes, cost control, and the ability to intervene at any stage of AI operations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Context switching productivity loss:** Constant switching between multiple AI chat interfaces, code editors, and documentation tools breaks development flow
- **Copy-paste workflow errors:** Manual transfer of context and outputs between tools introduces errors and loses conversation state
- **No cost visibility or control:** AI operations consume budget without clear tracking or approval gates
- **Lack of central coordination:** No unified view of development artifacts, agent activities, or project progress
- **Context management overhead:** Repeatedly providing the same project context to different AI tools
- **No audit trail:** Limited visibility into what AI agents actually did and why

### Success Criteria
- Complete development cycles without leaving the webapp
- Full audit trail and cost transparency for all AI operations
- Dramatic productivity improvement through eliminated context switching
- Maintained control and oversight of all AI agent activities
- Seamless coordination between multiple AI agents and tools

## Core Vision

### Primary Concept
A single interface where the user communicates primarily with a Producer AI agent that coordinates other specialized AI agents (Lead Engineer, Designer, QA, Security Specialist, etc.) while maintaining complete visibility and control over the development process.

### User Interaction Model
The user works collaboratively with the Producer AI to plan and coordinate development work. The Producer suggests agent assignments, context allocation, and work breakdown, which the user can approve, modify, or redirect. All agent operations are visible in real-time with intervention controls.

### Control Philosophy
The system defaults to productivity through automation while maintaining human control through approval gates, real-time monitoring, and easy intervention capabilities. The user is an active participant in coordination decisions rather than a passive recipient of AI output.

## System Architecture Overview

### Agent and Role System
- **Agents** represent capabilities (Lead Engineer, Designer, QA, Security Specialist, Documentation Writer)
- **Roles** represent specific job contexts within those capabilities (Code Reviewer, Tech Spec Writer, Red Team Analyst)
- Same agent can assume different roles with different prompts and context
- Role-based context rules and performance tracking

### Project Management Structure
- **Multiple isolated projects** with independent contexts and agent teams
- **Project-specific artifact folders** and deliverable tracking
- **Independent conversation histories** per project
- **Configurable workflow phases** per project type (Vision, Design, Implementation, Testing, etc.)
- **Typical usage:** 1-3 active projects simultaneously

### Context Management System
- **Flat context library** of discrete resources (documents, code files, prompts, specifications)
- **Inclusion rules** specifying what context gets provided to which agent/role/task combinations
- **Dynamic context requests** allowing agents to ask for additional context mid-task
- **Proactive context planning** with user-controlled fallback requests
- **Context sharing coordination** across multiple agents working on related tasks

### Multi-Tool Integration
Smart routing and coordination between three primary tools:
- **Producer AI (API-based)** for routine coordination and planning
- **Web chat handoffs** for complex strategic work requiring full Claude capabilities
- **Claude Code integration** for implementation and file operations
- **OpenAI API** for quick tactical tasks like code reviews

### Cost Control and Transparency
- **Real-time cost accumulation** with running totals per project
- **Cost prediction** for pending operations with estimation accuracy tracking
- **Manual approval gates** with configurable thresholds
- **Tool selection transparency** showing cost implications of routing decisions
- **Budget tracking** with alerts and spending analysis

### Safety and Version Control
- **Manual git snapshots** before risky operations
- **Easy rollback capabilities** to known good states
- **File operation tracking** with integrity checking
- **Complete audit trail** of all agent actions and decisions
